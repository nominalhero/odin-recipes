<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 ribs celery, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large turkey wings</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>10 cups cold water</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>alt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine onion, carrots, celery, and vegetable oil in a large roasting pan and toss to coat. Place turkey wings on top of vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until turkey wings are browned and vegetables are caramelized and softened, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer turkey wings and vegetables to a large stockpot. Place the roasting pan over a stovetop burner set to medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons cold water into the pan and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Transfer mixture to the stockpot and add 10 cups cold water, thyme, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Bring turkey wing mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off the bone, about 3 hours. Skim off turkey fat throughout the process and set aside 2 tablespoons.</li>
        <li>Strain turkey stock and reserve 6 cups of stock; discard all the solids.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and 2 tablespoons reserved turkey fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and cook, whisking constantly, until it begins to smell like cooked pie crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly pour in reserved turkey stock, whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and simmer gravy until thick and warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with cayenne, salt, and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
